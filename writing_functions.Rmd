## Writing functions 

z-score computation 
```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```

Write a function to do this. 

```{r}
z_scores = function(x){
  if( !is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  if(length(x) < 5) {
    stop("you need at least five numbers to compute the z score")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```

Does this always work?

error = TRUE allows rmd to knit with errors
```{r error = TRUE}
z_scores(x = 3)
z_scores(x = c("my", "name", "is", "Claudia"))
```
